% <latex>
% We have considered techniques for rational approximation 
% by best approximation on an
% interval (Chapter 24, {\tt remez}),
% interpolation or linearized least-squares fitting on an
% interval or disk (Chapter 26, {\tt ratinterp} and {\tt ratdisk}),
% and Pad\'e approximation at a point or Chebyshev--Pade approximation
% on an interval (Chapter 27, {\tt padeapprox} and {\tt chebpade}).
% In this final chapter, we turn to the application of such approximations for
% extrapolating a function to real or complex values $z$ outside the region
% where it is initially known. Three of the applications listed in Chapter
% 23 fall into this category: those numbered 3 (convergence acceleration for sequences
% and series), 4 (determination of poles), and 5 (analytic continuation).
% </latex>

%%
% It will be a chapter more of examples than theory. For an example to
% begin the discussion, suppose we pretend that we can evaluate
% $$ f(z) = \tanh(z) $$
% for real values of $z$ but know nothing about complex values, and we wish to
% estimate where $f$ has poles.  How might we proceed? (Of course we really
% know the answer: there are poles at all the odd multiples of $\pm \pi
% i/2$.)

%%
% The first thing to try might be polynomials.  For example, we could use
% Chebfun to construct a polynomial that approximates $f$ to 16 digits on
% $[-1,1]$,
%%
% <latex> \vskip -2em </latex>
f = @(z) tanh(z); p = chebfun(f); length(p)
%%
% <latex>
% From here, however, it is hard to make much progress.  As we know from
% Chapter~8, $p$ will be a good approximation to $f$ within a certain
% Bernstein ellipse, the Chebfun ellipse, which can be plotted by the
% command {\tt chebellipseplot}.  We can expect this ellipse to reach
% approximately out to the first singularities at $\pm \pi i/2$.  Once we
% hit the ellipse, however, everything will change.
% According to the theory of Walsh [1959] and Blatt and Saff [1986] mentioned in Chapter~18,
% zeros of $p$ will cluster all along the boundary, and a further result of Blatt and
% Saff states that outside the ellipse, there will be no convergence at all.  The
% polynomial $p$ will simply grow rapidly, its behavior having nothing
% to do with that of $f$.  We can confirm this prediction with contour
% plots. Here are plots of $|f(z)|$ and $|\kern .7pt p(z)|$ in the upper
% half-plane, with black contours at levels $0.25, 0.5, \dots , 3$ and red
% contours at $10^1, 10^3, 10^5, \dots, 10^{19}$. We see immediately that
% $p$ matches $f$ very well inside the Chebfun ellipse, which is marked in
% blue, but not at all outside.

% To get better information, we turn to rational approximation. A practical
% approach is to use |ratinterp| to compute rational linearized least-squares
% approximations of $f$ in $[-1,1]$.  Specifically, suppose we take $r$ to
% be the type $(7,8)$ approximation to $f$ in 1000 Chebyshev
% points and draw the same contour plots as before.  The picture changes
% completely, showing very impressive agreement over most of the range
% plotted. This is the power and the promise of rational approximation.

%%
% Results like these become all the more remarkable when one recalls that
% the problem of analytic continuation is ill-posed: analytic continuations
% are unique, but they do not depend continuously on the data.  For
% example, the following observation shows the ill-posedness of the problem
% of continuing a function analytically from the interval $(-1,1)$ to the
% unit disk. If $f$ is analytic in the disk, then for any $\varepsilon>0$,
% there is another function $g$ analytic in the disk such that $\|f-g\|\ge
% 1$ on the disk and yet $\|f-g\|\le \varepsilon$ on the interval.  (Proof:
% perturb $f$ by $\varepsilon\sin(Mz)$ for a suitable value of $M$.)
% Because of this ill-posedness, every successful example of numerical
% analytic continuation must entail some smoothness assumptions about $f$,
% whether implicit or explicit. That is to say, numerical analytic
% continuation always involves some kind of regularization.  (A standard
% reference on this subject is [Hansen 1998].) In the computations just
% shown, the regularization is introduced by the use of the SVD in
% |ratinterp|.

%%
% The question with which we opened the discussion was, where are the poles
% of $\tanh(z)\kern .7pt$?  To experiment with this, let us now apply
% |ratinterp| to compute approximants of types $(2,2), (3,3), \dots ,
% (8,8)$, and examine the poles of these approximations. In the next
% output, following the convention of the past few chapters, $(m,n)$
% represents the permitted type of each approximant and $(\kern .5pt
% \mu,\nu)$ the exact type, with $\mu\le m$ and $\nu\le n$. Note that
% $(\kern .5pt \mu,\nu)$ always comes out in the form
% $(\hbox{odd},\hbox{even})$, because $f$ is an odd function.  Thus there
% are always an even number of poles, which come in complex conjugate pairs
% and are pure imaginary, and we print just their positive imaginary parts.

%%
% The table shows that for larger values of $(m,n)$, two of the poles lie

% three poles of $\tanh(z)$  in the upper half-plane:

%%
% Evidently the type $(7,8)$ approximation has captured the first two poles
% to 9 and 3 digits of accuracy, respectively, numbers that are consistent
% with the contour levels near $z=1.57i$ and $4.71i$ in the last contour
% plot.

%%
% <latex>
% To understand computations like this, it is important to recognize that
% the ``goal'' of $r$ is not to find the poles of $f$, but simply to
% approximate $f$ over $[-1,1]$. If $r$ turns out to have poles near those
% of $f$, this is a by-product, a side effect that happened because placing
% poles there is an effective strategy for approximation.\footnote{Still,
% side effects can be the basis of powerful algorithms.  An example is the
% Lanczos iteration in numerical linear algebra, which is the standard
% method of computing extreme eigenvalues of large symmetric matrices
% [Trefethen \& Bau 1997]. Using this method, it is often possible
% to find a few dozen eigenvalues of a matrix even if the dimension is in
% the millions. Yet at bottom, the Lanczos iteration does nothing but
% construct a polynomial to minimize a certain norm.  The accurate
% eigenvalues are a by-product of the minimization, since the optimal
% polynomial has roots close to some of the eigenvalues of the matrix
% [Trefethen \& Greenbaum 1994, Kuijlaars 2006].}  To illustrate this,
% suppose we compare the type $(7,8)$ approximation above to one of type
% $(15,8)$. One might expect that with more degrees of freedom, the new
% approximation would capture the first pole more accurately.  In fact, the
% approximation returned has exact type $(15,2)$, and the  accuracy of the
% pole has deteriorated, because the denominator is less important to the
% quality of the least-squares approximation:

yi = sort(imag(poles)); fprintf('%15.10fi',yi(yi>0))

%%
% If we go further and ask for a type $(35,8)$ approximant, |ratinterp|
% returns an approximation with no poles at all.  The numerator now
% provides so much flexibility for the least-squares problem that the
% degrees of freedom in the denominator are not needed in 16-digit
% arithmetic, putting us back in the situation of the Chebfun ellipse of
% the first plot of this chapter.

% One must always bear this in
% mind when using rational approximations for extrapolation: increasing $m$

% cares about.

%%
% One way to get an idea of the dependence of an approximation on $m$ and
% $n$ is to print a table of digits of accuracy.  The following table, for
% example, indicates the number of digits of accuracy in the computed first
% pole of $\tanh(z)$ for $m = 1,3,5,\dots,19$ and $n = 2,4,6,\dots,20$, all
% based on robust least-squares fits in 200 Chebyshev points in 16-digit
% arithmetic.  The table shows again the effect that increasing $m$ beyond
% a certain small value---moving right in the table---diminishes the
% accuracy of the pole.

% The use of rational approximations for locating poles or other
% singularities has an honorable history.  Many applications are mentioned
% in the monograph by Baker and Graves-Morris [1996], which is a standard
% reference on $\hbox{Pad\'e}$ approximation.  One interesting kind of
% application is to locating singularities of solutions of ODEs or PDEs
% computed numerically, an idea explored among others by Weideman [2003].
% For Chebfun-based explorations, including the application of |ratinterp|
% to find complex singularities of solutions to the Lorenz and
% Lottka--Volterra equations, see $\hbox{[Pach\'on 2010]}$ and [Webb 2012].

%%
% Having just mentioned $\hbox{Pad\'e}$ approximation, which was the
% subject of the last chapter, let us now turn to this alternative method
% of constructing rational approximations.  Here is a repetition of the
% last experiment, the table of digits of accuracy in the first pole of
% $\tanh(z)$, but now based on $\hbox{Pad\'e}$ approximation instead of
% rational least-squares.  The results are similar, but better. This is not
% a general conclusion: it depends on the problem.

% In principle, least-squares fitting and $\hbox{Pad\'e}$ approximation are
% very different techniques, since the first uses function values only 
% at many different points, whereas the second uses values of the function
% and its derivatives at a single point.  (These are the extreme cases of
% the general notion of $\hbox{{\em multipoint Pad\'e approximation.})}$
% In our actual computation, however, the difference is diminished, because
% |padeapprox| begins by computing Taylor coefficients numerically by the
% FFT based on samples of the function at roots of unity, a standard
% technique. So in fact, in this comparison, |ratinterp| and |padeapprox|
% both work from function values: the first from samples on $[-1,1]$, the
% second from samples on the unit circle.  This raises the question, what is
% achieved by passing through the intermediate stage of Taylor
% coefficients?  It is a fair point, and indeed, another effective approach
% would be to solve a rational least-squares problem on the circle directly
% as in Chapter 26.  Explorations of this kind are presented in
% $\hbox{[Pach\'on 2010].}$

%%
% We now turn to the topic of acceleration of convergence of
% sequences and series.  The challenge here is as follows.
% Suppose we know some of the initial terms of a convergent sequence,
% $$ s_0, s_1, s_2, s_3, \dots \to S, \eqno (28.1) $$
% and we want to estimate the limit $S$.  Equivalently, suppose we
% wish to estimate the limit of an infinite sum,
% $$ S = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \cdots.   \eqno (28.2) $$
% The two problems are equivalent since we may regard (28.1) as a sequence
% of partial sums,
% $$ s_n = \sum_{k=0}^n a_k, \quad a_k = s_{k+1}-s_k. \eqno (28.3) $$
% If the sequence or series converges slowly, how might we speed it up? For
% example, perhaps we can afford to compute 20 terms, but this gives just
% 2-digit accuracy. Can we process the data further somehow to improve the
% accuracy to 6 digits?

%%
% <latex>
% There is a long history to such questions, reaching from Stirling and Euler
% to the recent tour de force
% solution of nine of the ten ``SIAM 100-Digit Challenge'' problems to
% 10,000 digits of accuracy [Bornemann et al.\ 2004].
% It is probably fair to say that almost every method for
% accelerating convergence is based on the idea of embedding the sequence
% in an analytic function, though this may not be how the original authors
% conceived or described their method.
% </latex>

%%
% <latex>
% One way in which a sequence might be embedded in an analytic function is
% if the terms of the sequence can be regarded as values of a fixed
% function at different arguments.  For example, suppose we define a function
% $f(z)$ at the points $z = 1, 2^{-1}, 2^{-2}, \dots$ by the formula $f(2^{-k})
% = s_k$. Then (28.1) becomes
% $$ f(1), f(2^{-1}), f(2^{-2}),  \dots \to S. \eqno (28.4) $$
% Does this point of view help us estimate $S$?  The answer will probably
% be yes if there exists a function $f$ that is analytic in a neighborhood
% of $z=0$ and takes the given values at $z=2^{-k}$.  In such a case, to
% estimate $S$, it is enough to interpolate some of the data by a
% polynomial $p(z)$ and then compute $p(0)$.  This is the method known as
% {\em Richardson extrapolation}, which is of
% great practical importance in applications.\footnote{Lewis Fry Richardson
% used such ideas as early as 1910, and for a systematic
% treatment see his charming article [Richardson 1927].  There are various earlier
% roots of Richardson extrapolation too, including Huygens in the 17th century.}
% In a typical application,
% $h$ might be the mesh size of a numerical discretization and $f(h),
% f(h/2), f(h/4),\dots$ the estimates obtained of a quantity of interest as
% the mesh is successively refined.  Often only even powers of $h$ appear,
% indicating that $f$ is an even function, so one could take the view that
% the data are given at $\pm h, \pm h/2, \dots$ 
% and Richardson extrapolation is really
% Richardson interpolation.  In the specific case in which
% $f(h)$ is an estimate of an integral by the trapezoid or rectangle rule
% with step length $h$, this becomes the quadrature method known as {\em
% Romberg quadrature}. Nor is the idea of polynomial extrapolation from
% data such as (28.4) limited to cases in which the sample points are
% related by factors of $2$. If they are $1, 1/2, 1/3,\dots,$ this is
% called {\em Salzer extrapolation} [Salzer 1955].
% </latex>

%%
% Often, however, the limit of a sequence or series is not in the interior
% of a region of analyticity of an analytic function. In such a case there
% may be less mileage in Richardson extrapolation, and one looks for
% formulations adapted to the edge of a region of analyticity. For such
% problems, there is a basic starting point: to insert a parameter $z$ in
% (28.2) so that it becomes the series
% $$ S(z) = a_0 + a_1z + a_2z^2 + \cdots .  \eqno (28.5) $$
% Now we have the problem of evaluating $S(1)$ for a function $S(z)$ with
% known Taylor coefficients. If (28.2) converges, then $z=1$ is a point of
% convergence of (28.5), and if (28.2) converges more slowly than
% geometrically, then $z=1$ must be on the boundary of the disk of
% convergence of (28.5).  So by introducing a parameter $z$, we have
% converted the problem of the summation of a slowly convergent series to a
% problem of evaluating an analytic function at a point on the boundary of
% the disk of convergence of its Taylor series.

%%
% The simplest idea would be to evaluate $S(z)$ for a succession
% of values of $z$ and use the identity
% $$ S(1) = \lim_{z\to 1} S(z), $$
% where the limit is over real values of $z$ increasing to $1$.
% This idea is known as _Abel summation_ [Hardy 1991].

%%
% <latex>
% A more powerful and general approach is to use rational functions,
% specifically Pad\'e approximants since the data are given as Taylor
% coefficients. Two variants of this idea have received special attention.
% We could construct a sequence of type $(m,1)$ Pad\'e approximants, with
% one pole, and evaluate them at $z=1$:
% $$ r_{01}(1), r_{11}(1), r_{21}(1), \dots. $$
% This is called {\em Aitken extrapolation} or {\em Aitken's
% $\Delta^2$ method,} used by Aitken [1926] though with
% origins further back. Or we could work with type $(n,n)$
% Pad\'e approximants,
% $$ r_{00}(1), r_{11}(1), r_{22}(1), \dots. $$
% This is called {\em epsilon extrapolation} (originally for sequences)
% [Shanks 1955, Wynn 1956] or {\em eta extrapolation} (originally for series) [Bauer 1959].
% An earlier appearance of essentially the same idea is due
% to Schmidt [1941].
% </latex>

%%
% Here is an example showing how powerful eta extrapolation can be for some
% problems.  What is the value of
% $$ S = \sum_{n=2}^\infty {\sin(n)\over \log(n)} ? $$
% The series is extremely slow to converge, as we see by taking partial
% sums of as many as a million terms:

% <latex> \vskip -2em </latex>

for n = 10.^[1:6]
  fprintf('%6.1e   %10.6f\n',n,S(n))
end

%%
% To get 10-digit accuracy by summing the series in this fashion, we would
% need $10^{10000000000}$ terms! The actual answer (not known analytically)
% is
% $$ S \approx 0.68391378641828\dots . $$
  
%%
% Here are the diagonal extrapolants, that is, the results of eta extrapolation.
% Now we just go from $2^1$ to $2^6$ instead of from $10^1$ to $10^6$, yet we get
% 14 digits of accuracy instead of 1:

%%
% The convergence is excellent.  Note that we have computed $\hbox{Pad\'e}$
% approximants non-robustly by specifying a tolerance of $0$ to |padeapprox|.
% In typical applications, this use of non-robust formulas
% seems advantageous in extrapolation applications, though
% it brings a risk of sensitivity to noise.  For this example,
% calling |padeapprox| with its default tolerance $10^{-14}$ leads
% to stagnation at type $(15,15)$ with just 7 digits of accuracy.

%%
% This simple method of eta extrapolation, at least as
% implemented by Chebfun's $\hbox{Pad\'e}$ approximation code, can be encapsulated
% in a single Matlab command we may call |extrap|.  Given a sequence
% $a_0, a_1, ..., a_N$, we can round $N/2$ to integers (say, round up
% for $m$ and down for $n$) and then use |padeapprox| to compute
% the type $(m,n)$ $\hbox{Pad\'e}$ approximation $r$.  The
% accelerated value is then $r(1)$.  Here is the code.

% For another example, suppose we extrapolate the alternating series
% $$ 1 - {1\over 2} + {1\over 3} - \cdots = \log(2), \eqno (28.6) $$

% <latex> \vskip -2em </latex>
extrap((-1).^(0:30)./(1:31)), exact = log(2)

%%
% Note that here, the function $f$ of (28.5) is
% $\log(1+z)$, so this example shows that eta extrapolation can be effective for
% functions with branch cuts as well as poles.

%%
% Another famous alternating series, which we can obtain by setting
% $t=0$ in equation (9.3), is
% $$ 1 - {1\over 3} + {1\over 5} - \cdots = {\pi\over 4}, \eqno (28.7) $$

extrap((-1).^(0:30)./(1:2:61)), exact = pi/4

%%
% These examples are very impressive, but it is not always so.  For example, 
% here is what happens if we attempt to extrapolate the series
% $$ \zeta(2) = 1 + {1\over 2^2} + {1\over 3^2} + \cdots = {\pi^2\over 6}, \eqno (28.8) $$

extrap(1./(1:30).^2), exact = pi^2/6

%%
% The convergence is very poor because in this case the function $f(z)$ of (28.5),
% known as the dilogarithm, has a branch point at $z=1$ itself.  As it happens,
% this is a case where Salzer extrapolation is effective (Exercise 28.3).

%%
% The discussion of convergence acceleration of the last five pages has
% little in common with the large literature of this subject, because our
% focus has been solely on the underlying approximations, particularly
% $\hbox{Pad\'e}$ approximants, and not at all on the mechanics.
% Our numerical illustrations have utilized the linear algebra of
% Chapter 27, based on the SVD and requiring $O(n^3)$ floating-point
% operations to compute a single estimate based on a type $(n,n)$
% approximant.  The literature of convergence acceleration is quite different, for it
% emphasizes recurrence relations and triangular or rhomboidal arrays related
% to continued fractions that
% can be used to generate a sequence of approximations at great speed

% A major reason why we have ignored the mechanical or implementational aspects of
% convergence acceleration is that these 
% matters are complicated---and, one might say, distracting.
% The differences between various
% extrapolation algorithms in practice can be quite intricate, and in a
% discussion of such matters, one quickly loses sight of the underlying
% mathematics of approximation. For details of these aspects of convergence
% acceleration see surveys such as Chapter 3 of
% [Baker \& Graves-Morris 1996], [Brezinski \& Redivo Zaglia 1991], [Gragg 1972],
% [Joyce 1971], [Sidi 2003], [Weniger 1989], [Wimp 1981], or the appendix
% by Laurie in [Bornemann, et al.\ [2004].  Such literature also points
% to many further acceleration methods beyond those we have mentioned,
% such as Levin's sequence transformation and Brezinski's
% theta method.

% We finish with an observation that points to exciting further
% territories of interest to mathematicians at least since Euler.
% The series (28.5) consists just of Taylor coefficients, so it
% is meaningful even if the radius of convergence is less than $1$.  Therefore our
% methods based on analytic continuation can sum divergent series as well
% as convergent ones. For example, the Taylor series
% $$ {1\over 1+z} = 1 - z + z^2 - z^3 + \cdots $$
% suggests the result
% $$ 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + \cdots = {1\over 2} , \eqno (28.9) $$
% if we set $z=1$.  Similarly, setting $z = 2$ suggests
% $$ 1 - 2 + 4 - 8 + \cdots = {1\over 3} . \eqno (28.10) $$
% Are these identities actually ``correct''?  As usual
% in mathematics, the answer depends on what definitions we choose.
% The formulas (28.9) and (28.10) are not too problematic since they correspond to Taylor series
% with positive radii of convergence.  In more challenging cases,
% the series is only asymptotic.  For example,
% what about this series with factorial coefficients considered by Euler [1760],
% $$ 0! - 1! + 2! - 3! + \cdots = ~? \eqno (28.11) $$
% The factorials grow too fast to be Taylor coefficients for any function analytic
% in a neighborhood of $z=0$.  However, they are the asymptotic
% series coefficients at $z=0$
% for a function analytic in the right half-plane, namely
% $$ f(z) = \int_0^\infty {e^{-t}\over 1+zt} \kern .7pt dt. \eqno (28.12) $$
% So a plausible candidate for the sum of (28.11) is
% $$ 0! - 1! + 2! - 3! + \cdots = f(1) =
% 0.596347362\dots . \eqno (28.13) $$
% Our code |extrap| makes a creditable attempt at computing this number:
