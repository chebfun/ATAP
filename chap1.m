%% 1. Introduction 

%%
% Welcome to a beautiful subject!---the constructive approximation of
% functions.  And welcome to a rather unusual book.
%

%%
% Approximation theory is an established field, and my aim is to teach you
% some of its most important ideas and results, centered on classical
% topics related to polynomials and rational functions.  The style of this
% book, however, is quite different from what you will find elsewhere.
% Everything is illustrated computationally with the help of the Chebfun
% software package in Matlab, from Chebyshev interpolants to Lebesgue
% constants, from the Weierstrass approximation theorem to the Remez
% algorithm.  Everything is practical and fast, so we will routinely
% compute polynomial interpolants or Gauss quadrature weights for tens of
% thousands of points. In fact, each chapter of this book is a single
% Matlab M-file, and the book has been produced by executing these files
% with the Matlab ``publish'' facility. The chapters come from M-files
% called |chap1.m|, $\kern -2pt\dots,$ |chap28.m| and you can download them
% and use them as templates to be modified for explorations of your own.

%%
% Beginners are welcome, and so are experts, who will find familiar topics
% approached from new angles and familiar conclusions turned on their
% heads. Indeed, the field of approximation theory came of age in an era of
% polynomials of degrees perhaps O(10). Now that O(1000) is easy and
% O(1,000,000) is not hard, different questions come to the fore.  For
% example, we shall see that ``best'' approximants are hardly better than
% ``near-best'', though they are much harder to compute, and that, contrary
% to widespread misconceptions, numerical methods based on high-order
% polynomials can be extremely efficient and robust.

% This is a book about approximation, not Chebfun, and for the most
% part we shall use Chebfun tools with little explanation. For information
% about Chebfun, see \verb|http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/chebfun|.\ \ In the
% course of the book we shall use Chebfun overloads of the following Matlab
% functions, among others: \vspace{-1em}

%%
%   CONV, CUMSUM, DIFF, INTERP1, NORM, POLY, POLYFIT, ROOTS, SPLINE

%%
% <latex>\noindent
% as well as additional Chebfun commands such as

%%
%   CF, CHEBELLIPSEPLOT, CHEBPADE, CHEBPOLY, CHEBPTS,
%   LEBESGUE, LEGPOLY, LEGPTS, PADEAPPROX,
%   RATINTERP, REMEZ.

%%
% There are quite a number of excellent books on approximation theory.
% Three classics are [Cheney 1966], [Davis 1975], and [Meinardus 1967], and
% a slightly more recent computationally oriented classic is [Powell 1981].
% Perhaps the first approximation theory text was [Borel 1905].

%%
% A good deal of my emphasis will be on ideas related to Chebyshev points
% and polynomials, whose origins go back more than a century to
% mathematicians including Chebyshev (1821--1894), de la $\hbox{Vall\'ee}$
% Poussin (1866--1962), Bernstein (1880--1968), and Jackson (1888--1946).
% In the computer era, some of the early figures who developed ``Chebyshev
% technology,'' in approximately chronological order, were Lanczos,
% Clenshaw, Good, Fox, Elliott, Mason, Orszag, Paszkowski,
% and V. I. Lebedev.  Five
% books on Chebyshev polynomials are by Snyder [1966], Paszkowski [1975],
% Fox and Parker [1968], Rivlin
% [1990], and Mason and Handscomb [2003]. One reason we emphasize Chebyshev
% technology so much is that in practice, for working with functions on
% intervals, these methods are unbeatable. For example, we shall see in
% Chapter 16 that the difference in approximation power between Chebyshev
% and ``optimal'' interpolation points is utterly negligible. Another
% reason is that if you know the Chebyshev material well, this is the best
% possible foundation for work on other approximation topics, and for
% understanding the links with Fourier analysis.

%%
% My style is conversational, but that doesn't mean the material is all
% elementary.  The book aims to be more readable than most, and the
% numerical experiments help achieve this. At the same time, theorems are
% stated and proofs are given, often rather tersely, without all the
% details spelled out. It is assumed that the reader is comfortable with
% rigorous mathematical arguments and familiar with ideas like continuous
% functions on compact sets, Lipschitz continuity, contour integrals in the
% complex plane, and norms of operators.  If you are a student, I hope you
% are an advanced undergraduate or graduate who has taken courses in
% numerical analysis and complex analysis. If you are a seasoned
% mathematician, I hope you are also a Matlab user.

%%
% Each chapter has a collection of exercises, which span a wide range from
% mathematical theory to Chebfun-based numerical experimentation. Please do
% not skip the numerical exercises!  If you are going to do that, you might
% as well put this book aside and read one of the classics from the 1960s.

% To give readers easy access to all the examples in executable form,
% the book was produced using {\tt publish} in \LaTeX\ mode: thus this
% chapter, for example, can be generated with the Matlab command {\tt
% publish('chap1','latex')}. To achieve the desired layout, we begin each
% chapter by setting a few default parameters concerning line widths for
% plots, etc., which are collected in an M-file called {\tt ATAPformats}
% that is included with the standard distribution of Chebfun.  Most readers
% can ignore these details and simply apply {\tt publish} to each
% chapter. For the actual production of the printed book, {\tt publish} was
% executed not chapter-by-chapter but on a concatenation of all the
% chapters, and a few tweaks were made to the resulting \LaTeX\ file, 
% including removal of Matlab commands whose effects are evident from
% looking at the figures, like {\tt title}, {\tt axis}, {\tt hold
% off}, and {\tt grid on}.

% The Lagrange interpolation formula was discovered by Waring, the Gibbs
% phenomenon was discovered by Wilbraham, and the Hermite integral formula
% is due to Cauchy. These are just some of the instances of Stigler's Law
% in approximation theory, and in writing this book I have taken pleasure
% in trying to cite the originator of each of the main ideas. Thus the
% entries in the references section stretch back several centuries, and
% each has an editorial comment attached.  Often the original papers are
% surprisingly readable and insightful, at least if you are comfortable
% with French or German, and in any case, it seems particularly important
% to pay heed to original sources in a book like this that aims to
% reexamine material that has grown too standardized in the textbooks.
% Another reason for looking at original sources is that in the last few
% years it has become far easier to track them down, thanks to the
% digitization of journals, though there are always difficult special cases
% like [Wilbraham 1848], which I finally found in an elegant leather-bound
% volume in the Balliol College library. No doubt I have missed originators
% of certain ideas, and I would be glad to be corrected on such points by
% readers. For a great deal of information about approximation theory,
% including links to dozens of classic papers, see the History of
% Approximation Theory web site at

%%
% Perhaps I may add a further personal comment.  As an undergraduate and
% graduate student in the late 1970s and early 1980s, one of my main
% interests was approximation theory.  I regarded this subject as the
% foundation of my wider field of numerical analysis, but as the years
% passed, research in approximation theory came to seem to me dry and
% academic, and I moved into other areas.  Now times have changed,
% computers have changed, and my perceptions have changed.  I now again
% regard approximation theory as exceedingly close to computing, and in
% this book we shall discuss many practical numerical problems, including
% interpolation, quadrature, rootfinding, analytic continuation,
% extrapolation of sequences and series, and solution of differential
% equations.

%%
% Why is approximation theory useful?  The answer goes much further than
% the rather tired old fact that your computer relies on approximations to
% evaluate functions like $\sin(x)$ and $\exp(x)$.  For my personal answer
% to the question, concerning polynomials and rational functions in
% particular, take a look at the last three pages of Chapter 23, beginning
% with the quotes of Runge and Kirchberger from the beginning of the 20th
% century.  There are also many other fascinating and important topics of
% approximation theory not touched upon in this volume, including splines,
% wavelets, radial basis functions, compressed sensing, and multivariate
% approximations of all kinds.

%%
% <latex>
% In summary, here are some distinctive features of this book:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The emphasis is on topics close to
% numerical algorithms.
% \item Everything is illustrated with Chebfun.
% \item Each chapter is a publishable M-file, available online.
% \item There is a bias toward theorems and methods for analytic
% functions, which appear so often in applications, rather than
% on functions at the edge of discontinuity with their seductive
% theoretical challenges.
% \item Original sources are cited rather than textbooks,
% and each item in the bibliography is listed with an editorial comment.
% \end{itemize}
% At a more detailed level, virtually every chapter contains mathematical
% and scholarly novelties.  Examples are the use of barycentric formulas 
% beginning in Chapter~5, the tracing of barycentric formulas and the
% Hermite integral formula back to Jacobi in 1825 and Cauchy in 1826,
% Theorem 7.1 on the size of Chebyshev coefficients, the introduction to
% potential theory in Chapter 12, the discussion in Chapter 14 of
% prevailing misconceptions about interpolation, the presentation of
% colleague matrices for rootfinding in Chapter 18 with Jacobi matrices for
% quadrature as a special case in Chapter 19, Theorem 19.5 showing that
% Clenshaw--Curtis quadrature converges about as fast as Gauss
% quadrature, the first textbook presentation of Carath\'odory--Fej\'er
% approximation in Chapter~20, the explanation in Chapter 22 of why
% polynomials are not optimal functions for linear approximation, the
% extensive discussion in Chapter 23 of the uses of rational
% approximations, and the SVD-based algorithms for robust rational
% interpolation and linearized least-squares fitting
% and Pad\'e approximation in Chapters 26 and 27.
% </latex>

%%
% All in all, we shall see that there is scarcely an idea in classical
% approximation theory that cannot be illustrated in a few lines of Chebfun
% code, and as I first imagined around 1975, anyone who wants to be expert
% at numerical computation really does need to know this material.

% Dozens of people have helped me in preparing this book. I cannot name
% them all, but I would like to thank in particular Serkan Gugercin, Nick
% Higham, J\"org Liesen, Ricardo Pach\'on, and Ivo Panayotov for reading
% the whole text and making many useful suggestions, Jean-Paul Berrut for
% teaching me about rational functions and barycentric formulas, Folkmar
% Bornemann for bringing to light historical surprises involving Jacobi,
% Cauchy, and Marcel Riesz, and Volker Mehrmann for hosting a sabbatical
% visit to the Technical University of Berlin in 2010 during which much of
% the work was done.  I am grateful to Max Jensen of the University of
% Durham, whose invitation to give a 50-minute talk in March 2009 sparked
% the whole project, and to Marlis Hochbruck and Caroline Lasser for
% testing a draft of the book with their students in Karlsruhe and Munich.
% Here in the Numerical Analysis Group at Oxford, Endre S\"uli and
% Andy Wathen have been the finest colleagues one could ask
% for these past fifteen years, and the remarkable
% Lotti Ekert makes everything run smoothly.
% Finally, none of this would have been possible without the team who have
% made Chebfun so powerful and beautiful, my good friends Zachary Battles,
% \'Asgeir Birkisson, Toby Driscoll, Pedro Gonnet, Stefan G\"uttel, Nick
% Hale, Ricardo Pach\'on, Rodrigo Platte, Mark Richardson, and Alex
% Townsend.
